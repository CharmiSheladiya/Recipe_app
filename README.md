# Recipe_app

I have created a Food Recipes app which will have CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) features, 
allowing users to create, save, edit, and delete recipes, 
along with user authentication to ensure secure access to the app's functionality and user-specific data.

Technologies Used : Python, Django, HTML, Bootstrap
